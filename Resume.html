                        <br><br> Relevant areas of study:
                        <br> 3 years web design experience: 
                        <br> This could be useful if you need me to run tests or find flaws in a website. I fully know how to code in CSS and HTML, and partially know Javascript. I also know how to validate websites or find any issues in them, as well as being able to optimize a website.
                        <br> JS Knowledge:
                        <br> I have completed the AP Comp Sci course where we learned how to code simple apps using JS. This knowledge is also to a certain extent applicable to web design as JS is used quite often. 
                        <br> Back-End knowledge:
                        <br> I have learned about the basics of the back-end of computer networks, and encryption. This includes types of encryption and how to break/ crack encryption.
                        <br>  Work experience:
                        <br>  I have one year of experience working for LCTI&#39;s IT department, where I did a lot of troubleshooting and computer repairs. This ranged from repairing chromebooks with broken screens to setting up an image for a computer that we then deploy to dozens of computers.
                        <br>  Communication/ customer support skills:
                        <br>  Throughout my Co-op experience I got to work a lot with my customer service skills as I often had to interact with teachers and students to find the issues they were having. This was often done in person, but I also had to do some over email.
                        <br> Photoshop/ Illustrator Graphic design:
                        <br> I am very familiar with Illustrator and Photoshop and I am able to make my own graphics or edit already existing ones using these technologies. I have used Illustrator specifically to create my own logo and redesign a lot of logos.
