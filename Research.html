            Video Game Designers<br>
            15-1255.01<br><br>
            Description:<br>
            They create main features of video games. This can be anything from the code of the game to design choices in the game, and designing 3d or 2d models used in the game. They also make game narratives and stories.
            <br>
            Tasks:<br>
            The skills that I have attained that are applicable to this field of work are;
            <br>Story writing and character narrative skills
            <br> Patching bugs, and writing update/ patch notes and reports
            <br> Developing a well thought out level design
            <br> Creating good/ sensible levels and puzzles
            <br> Use feedback to make changes
            <br> Make a form for people to submit feedback in
            <br> Create 2D and 3D mockups and simple models.
            <br> Design overlays and menus
            <br> Somewhat use unreal engine to create levels
            <br> Other simple tasks
            
            <br><br> Education:
            <br> You will need a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in most cases with very few places requiring less than a bachelor's degree. I will get this by most likely attending a 2 year associates degree at LCCC and then transferring to Drexel or another university that will accept the transferred credits.
            
            <br><br> Skills:
            <br> Programming skills
            <br>Critical thinking skills
            <br>  Creativity 
            <br> Intuitive
            <br> Good problem solving
            <br> Decision making skills
            <br> Documentation
            <br>Active listening skills
            
            <br><br>  Wage and employment:
            <br>  The median wage in the US is $40.02 hourly and $83,240 annually. The state average is $62,300 annually. The wage and growth of this career within the state is not as big as it is within the US, but even within the state it is a good amount of pay. When compared to some other jobs within the field it is just about in the middle. Some of the cyber security jobs pay more, but some of the programming jobs pay less.

            <br><br> Tasks:
            <br>Some skills that I have developed that are applicable are;
            <br> Programming skills
            <br> Developing a good software that is simple
            <br> Critical thinking skills
            <br> Problem solving
            <br> Using feedback
            <br> Design a visually appealing software
            
            <br><br> Education:
            <br> You will need a 2-4 year degree in Computer Science. I will get this by most likely attending a 2 year associates degree at LCCC and then transferring to Drexel or another university that will accept the transferred credits.
            
            <br><br> Skills:
            <br> Programming skills
            <br>  Problem solving skills
